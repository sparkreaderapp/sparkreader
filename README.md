## About

SparkReader solves a common reading problem: breaking flow to look up nuanced vocabulary, cultural references, or complex passages. By providing inline AI explanations, it removes friction and preserves your connection to the text.

While Project Gutenberg offers around 75,000 public domain books, SparkReader focuses on a carefully curated, inclusive collection. For each category, we've selected well-known, representative works spanning different eras, countries, disciplines, and genres.

The goal is to preserve a meaningful connection to our shared human heritage without letting the sheer number of available books, language barriers, or historical and cultural context become prohibitive.
