## About

SparkReader solves a common reading problem: breaking flow to look up nuanced vocabulary, cultural references, or complex passages. By providing inline AI explanations, it removes friction and preserves your connection to the text.

While [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) offers around 75,000 public domain books, [SparkReader Library](https://sparkreader.app/library.html) narrows down on a carefully curated, inclusive collection. For each category, we've selected well-known, representative works spanning different eras, countries, disciplines, and genres.

The goal is to preserve a meaningful connection to our shared human heritage without letting the sheer number of available books, language barriers, or historical and cultural context become prohibitive.
