# 📚 SparkReader - AI-Powered Ebook Reader [Beta Testers Needed!]

Hey everyone! I've been working on an Android ebook reader called **SparkReader** that combines traditional reading with AI assistance, and I need 12 beta testers to help me get it ready for Google Play Store.

## What makes SparkReader different?

🤖 **AI Chat Integration** - Ask questions about what you're reading, get explanations of complex passages, or discuss themes with an AI assistant that understands your book's context

📖 **Smart Reading Features** - Built-in dictionary, contextual explanations, and quote extraction with proper citations

📱 **OCR Text Recognition** - Take photos of physical book pages and convert them to readable text using on-device AI models

📚 **Flexible Import Options** - Import from various sources including a curated library, or create books from images/text

🎨 **Modern Material Design** - Clean, customizable interface with dark/light themes

## Technical highlights:
- Runs AI models locally on your device (privacy-focused)
- Supports multiple AI model backends
- Smart pagination and text processing
- No internet required for core reading features

## What I need from beta testers:
- Test the app with different types of books/content
- Try out the AI chat features and OCR functionality  
- Report any bugs or usability issues
- Provide feedback on the overall reading experience

The app is built with modern Android development practices (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Hilt) and focuses on privacy - your reading data stays on your device.

**Interested in helping out?** Comment below or DM me! I'll send you the beta link once I have enough testers lined up.

Thanks for reading! 📖✨
