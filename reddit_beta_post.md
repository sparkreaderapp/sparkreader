# 📚 SparkReader - AI-Powered Reading Assistant [Need 12 Beta Testers!]

Hey Reddit! I've built an Android ebook reader called **SparkReader** that's unlike anything else out there. I need 12 beta testers to help me polish it before launching on Google Play Store.

## What makes SparkReader special?

🧠 **Contextual AI Explanations** - Select any text while reading and get intelligent explanations that consider the full context of your book (not just dictionary definitions!)

💬 **Smart Chat Commands** - Ask questions like "explain this character" or "summarize page 15" and get relevant answers about your specific book

📸 **Advanced OCR** - Take photos of physical book pages and convert them to searchable text using on-device Gemma 3n model

📚 **Curated Library** - Access a starter collection of public domain classics, or import your own EPUBs

🔍 **Powerful Search** - Find text across pages with smart occurrence tracking and navigation

🎨 **Beautiful UI** - Modern Material Design 3 interface with customizable themes and reading preferences

## Key technical features:
- **100% offline** - All AI processing happens on your device (privacy first!)
- Supports multiple AI model backends with downloadable models
- Smart book tagging and organization system
- Advanced text selection with context menus
- Flexible import options (EPUB, images, manual text entry)

## What I need from beta testers:
- Test different book formats and import methods
- Try the AI explanation and chat features extensively
- Report bugs, crashes, or confusing UX
- Give feedback on reading experience and feature usefulness

The app is open source and built with modern Android stack (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Hilt, Room). Your reading data never leaves your device.
